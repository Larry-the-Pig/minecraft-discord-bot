# Minecraft Discord Bot
This is a bot that I made in Javascript. It's really sloppy so I would recommend not to use it, but it was an experiment.

- Can search players stats for Hypixel, 2b2t, and Hive, using their appropriate APIs (https://2b2t.dev/ for 2b2t)
- Can search the Minecraft Wiki for things using Mediawiki
- Can Gice you player skins and capes by using the Crafatar (https://github.com/crafatar/crafatar) and OptiFine (http://s.optifine.net/capes/)
- Has a list of all color codes
- Can give you a random title splash
- Can give you a random seed, and more.
